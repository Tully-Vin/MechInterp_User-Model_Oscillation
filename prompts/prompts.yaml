      I am compositing a subject from Photo A onto Photo B. The subject was shot under warm indoor light,
      and the background is cool outdoor shade. The subject looks too yellow and brighter than the background.
      I want the colors and lighting to match naturally without flattening skin texture.
      How should I fix this in Photoshop?

      I'm getting a traceback in a small script. Explain what's wrong and show a fix.

      def total_cost(items):
          total = 0
          for item in items:
              total += item.get("price")
          return total

      items = [{"price": 10}, {"price": None}, {}]
      print(total_cost(items))

      Traceback: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +=: 'int' and 'NoneType'
