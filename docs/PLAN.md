# 18-hour plan

Block 1 (2h) - finalize scope and metrics
- Confirm prompt suite and conditions
- Finalize technicality and oscillation metrics
- Decide model and generation settings

Block 2 (3h) - build and test pipeline
- Run 4-6 pilot conversations per domain
- Sanity check outputs and metric behavior
- Adjust prompts or settings if needed

Block 3 (3h) - full data collection
- Run full condition set for both domains
- Save all raw outputs and metadata

Block 4 (3h) - analysis and figures
- Compute technicality and oscillation metrics
- Produce core plots and summary tables

Block 5 (4h) - mechanistic-lite probe
- Train a simple expertise probe on hidden states
- Apply it across user turns
- One robustness check on a different prompt variant

Block 6 (3h) - write-up and summary
- Draft executive summary and main write-up
- Insert graphs and key tables
- Note limitations and next steps

Checkpoints
- After Block 2: you can generate stable outputs and metrics
- After Block 4: you have figures that show oscillation
- After Block 5: you have internal evidence or a negative result
