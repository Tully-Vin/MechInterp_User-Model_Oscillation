Findings
- Oscillatory feedback yields the largest instability in both domains. The effect is much stronger in Python.
- Anchoring reduces oscillation index and flip rate relative to oscillatory.
- Consistent_technical shows higher mean technicality, while consistent_basic drives it lower.
- Python oscillatory responses show large swings, likely amplified by code-vs-prose mode shifts.

Caveats
- The oscillation index may conflate a single large step change with true oscillation.
- n=10 per condition is small; variance is high in some cells.
