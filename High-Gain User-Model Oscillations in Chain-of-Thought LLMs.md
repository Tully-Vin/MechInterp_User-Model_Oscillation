# High-Gain User-Model Oscillations in Chain-of-Thought LLMs

## Hypothesis:

LLMs exhibit high-gain instability in conditional generation when inferring user expertise for users whose communication style spans multiple latent categories. This instability may arise from a combination of representational, decoding, training-distribution, and interface-level mechanisms.

## Claim:

Regardless of locus, this instability is mechanistically identifiable, causally relevant to output behaviour, and disproportionately impacts accessibility for non-normative users.
